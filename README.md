# anything2text

A Go library about to be Micro-service to convert PDF, DOC, DOCX, XML, HTML, RTF, ODT, Pages documents and images (Tesseract) to plain text.

## Installation

To fetch and build the code:

    $ go get github.com/mikewlange/anything2text/...

This will also build the command line tool `docd` into `$GOPATH/bin` (assumed to be in your `PATH` already).

## Dependencies
tidy, wv, popplerutils, unrtf,

https://github.com/JalfResi/justext
brew install poppler

Example install of dependencies (not all systems):

 lin   $ sudo apt-get install poppler-utils wv unrtf tidy
  mac  $ go get github.com/JalfResi/justext brew install poppler

Add image support to the `docconv` library you first need to install and build https://github.com/otiai10/gosseract.  Now you can add `-tags ocr` to any `go` command when building/fetching `docconv` to include support for processing images:

    $ go get -tags ocr github.com/mikewlange/anything2text/...
    
    ## docd tool

The `docd` tool runs as either

1. a service on port 8888 (by default)

   Documents can be sent as a multipart POST request and the plain text (body) and meta information are then returned as a JSON object

2. a service exposed from within a Docker container

   This also runs as a service, but from within a Docker container. There are two build scripts [./docd/debian.sh](./docd/debian.sh) and [./docd/alpine.sh](./docd/alpine.sh). 

   The debian version uses the Debian package repository which can vary with builds. The Alpine version uses a very cut down Linux distribution to produce a container ~40MB. It also locks the dependency versions for consistency, but may miss out on future updates.

3. via the command line.

   Documents can be sent as an argument, e.g.

   ```docd -input document.pdf```

### Optional Flags
 - "addr" - the bind address for the HTTP server, default is ":8888"
 - "log-level"
    - 0: errors & critical info
    - 1: inclues 0 and logs each request as well
    - 2: include 1 and logs the response payloads
 - "readability-length-low" - Sets the readability length low if the ?readability=1 parameter is set
 - "readability-length-high" - Sets the readability length high if the ?readability=1 parameter is set
 - "readability-stopwords-low" - Sets the readability stopwords low if the ?readability=1 parameter is set
 - "readability-stopwords-high" - Sets the readability stopwords high if the ?readability=1 parameter is set
 - "readability-max-link-density" - Sets the readability max link density if the ?readability=1 parameter is set
 - "readability-max-heading-distance" - Sets the readability max heading distance if the ?readability=1 parameter is set
 - "readability-use-classes - Comma separated list of readability classes to use if the ?readability=1 parameter is set

### How to start the service
```docd -log-level 0   # will only log errors & critical info ```

```docd -addr :8888 -log-level 1   # will run on port 8888 and log each request as well ```

## Example Usage (code)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"github.com/otiai10/gosseract"
	"github.com/sajari/docconv/client"
)

func main() {
	// Create a new client, using the default endpoint (localhost:8888)
	c := client.New()

        // docx to text 
	res, err := client.ConvertPath(c, "demo.docx")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(res)

        // OCR to text 
	out := gosseract.Must(gosseract.Params{
		Src:       "Text_Entropy.png",
		Languages: "eng",

	})
	fmt.Println(out)
    // docx to text ///////
}
```


A work in progress. Big props to https://github.com/sajari/docconv ! This is bactailly that + full tesseract OCR. Will deploy the completed system to IBM Blumix I think. I use Couch/Pouch for local storage and that automatically syncs with Cloudant.
